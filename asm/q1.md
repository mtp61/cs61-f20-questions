# Assembly question

This question involves the following non-optimized assembly code:

```
f1:
.LFB1:
	pushq	%rbp
	movq	%rsp, %rbp
	subq	$8, %rsp
	movl	%edi, -4(%rbp)
	movl	-4(%rbp), %eax
	movl	%eax, %edi
	call	f2
	movl	-4(%rbp), %edx
	addl	$5, %edx
	cmpl	%edx, %eax
	jne	.L4
	movl	$1, %eax
	jmp	.L5
.L4:
	movl	$0, %eax
.L5:
	mov   %rbp, %rsp
pop   %rbp
	ret
```

## Part A: What does the function “f1” do? More specifically, what are its arguments, if any, and what does it return? Explain or give c code that could have generated the assembly. 

## Part B: What function “f2” would make “f1” always return 1? Explain or write the function in C. 

## Part C: Write assembly code for your function “f2”.

## Part D: Does this function use the “red zone”? How do you know?
